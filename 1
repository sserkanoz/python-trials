# problem 1 : Let us assume that you invested at the end of 2017, which Bitcoin earned well. What would be your money at the end of a week if you had invested $ 1000 in bitcoine with an average daily increase of 12%? Please solve the problem using Python.
a = 1000
t = 7
n = 12
b = a * ((1 + n / 100) ** t)
print ("At the end of {} days, you will receive {} $.". format (t, b))
At the end of 7 days, you will receive 2210.6814074060812 $.
